A book that asks us to reconsider if the ego is a necessary
evil to drive success. In part, it does so by redefining what success is.
Is it winning against someone else, or is it becoming the best possible
version of ourselves?

It made me change my perception of ego, to where now I understand that people
have success in spite of their ego, as opposed to thanks to it.
