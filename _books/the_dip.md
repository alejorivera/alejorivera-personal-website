A book about knowing when to stick to something (when you have a change of
being the best in the world) or when to quit (when you don't).
It made me realize that quitting can be a very smart decision,
if done for the right reasons. If things get hard, don't quit, that means
that what you're doing is difficult and the barrier of entry will be high
for people who want to copy you. Quit only if you realize that you cannot be
best in the world at what you're doing.
