A collection of anecdotes and golden nuggets for life and business. This book
is good because Sivers is a non-conventional thinker and entrepreneur,
who has managed to stay true to himself and do things on his own terms.

My bookshelf page is in great part inspired by Derek Sivers own book page.

### Notes

> We've all head about the importance of persistence. But I had misunderstood.
Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from
persistently promoting what's not working. [If it's not a hit, switch!]

> The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you
happy.

> No business goes as planned, so make ten radically different plans.
Same thing with your current path in life.
Imagine yourself in NYC, obsesses with success.
Now imagine yourself backpacking in Thailand....

> Never forget why you're doing what you're doing. Are you helping people?
Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn't that enough?

> If you find even the smallest way to make people smile, they'll remember you
more for that smile than for all your other fancy business-model stuff.
