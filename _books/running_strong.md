This book is filled with actionable advice on how to prevent injuries, how
to treat injuries, and how to maintain a consistent running practice.
It helped me understand why I was having pain near the outer part of my knee
(IT band), and after a couple of months of following the advice in the book,
I was able to get back to running pain-free.

My biggest takeaways were:

- Strong butt = Happy life.
- Workout every day. Do strength training at least twice a week.
- Foam roll every day.
- Get a massage at least 1 at month, ideally bi-weekly.
