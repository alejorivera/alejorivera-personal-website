Hacktivismo tells the story of technology-driven changes in power.

When the printing press was invented, the ability to receive and read messages
changed from being in the hands of those who had access to books, to being in
the hands of everyone. This changed everything. People now had access to
knowledge and could form their own opinions about the world, which led to
massive revolutions like the Reformation.

With the web though, the ability to broadcast messages changed from being in the
hands of a few to being available to everyone. This again, is changing the
structure of power in society.

With the web, anyone can broadcast and receive messages at almost no cost, which
opens the doors to massive decentralization. Siri walks us through how this idea
can be applied to governance, education, money, and many other areas.

Ultimately, this is a book about how we can use technology as a force for good.
