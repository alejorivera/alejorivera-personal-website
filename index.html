    <h5>About ‚õµÔ∏è</h5>

    <p>
      I am currently working on
      <a href="https://www.getlearnhub.com">Learnhub</a>,
      an app that helps schools do more hands-on, collaborative learning.
      Learnhub was a part of
      <a href="http://www.startupchile.org/">Start-Up Chile</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="smaller">
      Previously, I worked as Head of School for
      <a href="//www.talentunbound.org">Talent Unbound</a>
       Galleria,  a
      micro-school in Houston TX.  Before TU, I started
      <a href="https://www.juntostudio.com">Junto Studio</a>,
      a web development studio with a remote team, and international clients.

    <h5>Bookshelf üìö</h5>

    I love reading. Recently, I started rating and posting notes about
    the books I read on my
    <a href="/bookshelf">books page</a>.
