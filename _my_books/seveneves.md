Seveneves was fascinating. I found the plot captivating and interesting, the
characters were deep and quirky, and the book had an overall good rhythm.

I enjoyed reading about orbits and the mechanics of how space vehicles can work.
All the physics in the book are well researched and accurate, and Stephenson
doesn't mind going into the details of how things work.

Reading science fiction books like this one, definitely stretches your
imagination.
