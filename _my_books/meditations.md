A book filled with wisdom about how to live a good life. Marcus Aurelius,
Emperor of Rome, and most powerful man of his time, wrote what became
Meditations as a diary, without any intention of it ever being read by someone else.

I feel so lucky that we're able to read through what he wrote, and get insights
into his mind.
