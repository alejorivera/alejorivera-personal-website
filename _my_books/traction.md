Traction is a book that solves one problem for you: How to get traction for your
company.

It presents a framework where out of 19 possible traction channels, you will
choose 3 to run tests with, then figure out which one is the most effective and
double down on it.

The authors of the book recommend that you spend 50% of the time building your
product, and the other 50% getting traction by optimizing that one channel which
you found most effective. I found this particularly interesting â€” that you
should focus on one channel only. However, if you're confident that that channel
is working for you and that it is the most effective, which you should be after
running tests, this strategy makes total sense.

Super easy to understand and fun to read.
