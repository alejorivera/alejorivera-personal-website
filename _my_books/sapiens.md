Sapiens is both a philosophy and a history book. Exploring the human specie
through its different epochs, from 6 million years ago (about the time where
chimpanzees and humans had the last common "grandmother") to the present time
(where we are genetically engineering new species and modifying others), begs
the question of: What's the purpose of evolution, both biological and social?

The author sees everything from the light of another question: Are we [through
evolution] reducing suffering and increasing happiness not only of the human
species, but of all living creatures?

Sapiens has led me to rethink how I understand the world around us â€“ How I
understand science, religion, nationalism and political systems, ethics, and
society.

My key insight from this book is that the circumstances that we are living right
now as a specie are a culmination of millions of years of scaffolding, both
because of nature finding the best way to solve a problem and a myriad of
coincidences.

We shouldn't take the tacit rules of our times as final, for we have been, and
we will be ever changing.
